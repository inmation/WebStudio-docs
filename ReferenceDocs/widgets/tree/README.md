# Tree

The Tree widget can be used to show hierarchical data in the form of nodes. Each node can have a sheer number of icons.

## Model

```jsonc
{
    "type": "tree",
    "data": [
        {
            "n": "node-01",     // Shown as the label of the node
            "c": []             // Children             
        }
    ],
    "schema": [],               // See Schema
    "searchTable": {}           // See Search Table
}
```

### Schema

In order to support data with different fields for the standard `n` and `c`, a mapping can be defined pointing to custom fields of your node data.

```jsonc
{
    "schema": {
        "name": "myNodeTitle",
        "children": "myListOfChildren"
    }
}
```

In case the search is used, it would be good to provide each node with an unique id. This way the underlying logic does not need to generate ids for each node. A custom id field can be configured.

Assigning icons to nodes can be done via the `schema`. Nodes can have an arbitrary number of icons. By default the icons are positioned to the left of the node name. Icons can also be assigned on the right side of the node name. This can done by providing an `alignment` field with the value `leading` or `trailing` and a `position` field in the icon definition. With `rules` you can assign a specific icon depending on the data of a node.

Icon position numbering:

| leading | node label | trailing |
| --- | --- | --- |
3 <- 2 <- 1 | MyNode | 1 -> 2 -> 3

Icons can be defined by:
| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| Emoji | "üåç" |
| URL to image | { "url": "" } |
| Base64 encoded | { "mimeType": "image/jpg", "base64": "" } |

```jsonc
{
    "schema": {
        "id": "i",                              // Default id field is 'i' or 'id'
        "name": "n",                            // Default name field is 'n'
        "children": "c",                        // Default children field is 'c'
        "icons": [                              // Generic for all nodes
            {
                "alignment": "leading",         // Default is 'leading'
                "position": 1,                  // Default index in the array + 1
                "icon": "‚ÑπÔ∏è",
                "actions": {}
            },
            {
                "alignment": "leading",
                "position": 2,
                "icon": "‚ùé",
                "actions": {}
            }
        ],
        "style": {                              // Node styling options
            "fontSize": "15px"
        },
        "rules": [                              // Node specific icons, actions and styling
            {
                "match": {},                    // Match query
                "actions": {},                  // Node actions
                "icons": [
                    {
                        "alignment": "leading",
                        "position": 2,
                        "icon": "üîç",
                        "actions": {}           // Action actions
                    }
                ],
                "style": {                      // Node styling options
                    "backgroundColor": "green",
                    "fontSize": "15px",
                    "fontWeight": "normal"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

The `schema` in the model will overrule the `schema` received from the data source fetch. By adding `extendSchemaFromDataSource` to the `schema` in the model you can make use of both. Typically scenario is that the system returns `data` containing the node structure and a `schema` containing icons and that the model `schema` has custom `actions`.

This `extendSchemaFromDataSource` property only applies for `schema` configuration which are defined in the model.

```json
{
    "schema": {
        "extendSchemaFromDataSource": true
    }
}
```

### Options

Node styling and icon assignment can be combined using the `rules` in the `options`. The configuration in the `schema` is dominant to this `options`.

```jsonc
{
    "options": {
        "rules": [
            {
                "match": {},
                "icons": [                      // List of icon definition
                    {
                        "icon": "‚ÑπÔ∏è",
                        "actions": {}           // See Actions
                    },
                    {
                        "icon": "üëÅ",
                        "actions": {}           // See Actions
                    }
                ],
                "style": {
                    "backgroundColor": "green",
                    "fontSize": "15px",
                    "fontWeight": "normal"
                }
            },
            {
                "match": {},
                "icons": [                      // List of icon definition
                    {
                        "alignment": "trailing",
                        "position": 1,
                        "icon": "üåç",
                        "actions": {}           // See Actions
                    }
                ],
                "style": {
                    "fontWeight": "bold"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

| name | description |
| ---- | --- |
| `allowSearch` | Shows the magnify glass button in the toolbar (default is true).
| `collapseOnSearchSelection` | The tree will be collapsed when a selection is made in the search table.
| `showRefreshButton` | Shows the refresh button in the toolbar (default is true).

### State
The tree widget maintains a list of expanded nodes by recording their "identifier" fields in the `state.expandedNodes` array. 

```json
{
    "state": {
        "expandedNodes": [ "1", "1.2" ]
    }
}
```

The "identifier" defaults to the provided schema `id` field (which must be unique in the tree). If an `id` is not provided, one will be automatically generated by encoding the index of the node at each level in the tree. For example, the second child node of the first root element would get `id` = "1.2"

In addition to tracking the `expandedNodes` state, the widget also uses this information to restore the tree to the same state when a reload is triggered. 

> **Note**: When the reload is due to new data being fetched, the tree state can only be reliably restored if the node ids before and after the load are the same. <br>This is not guaranteed when using "automatic" `id` generation since these are base on the position of the nodes in the tree which may change due to inserts or deletions. The recommendation is therefor to explicitly provide unique node ids whenever possible.  

The `expandedNodes` property can also be modified from an action pipeline to manipulate the tree's appearance. 

> **Note**: The whole `expandedNodes` array must be changed when doing so. Individual elements in the array cannot be changed. 

By way of example, suppose we have the following tree and want to expand it such that the "Machine X" node is visible.

```
Id      Name
------- -------------------
1       Site 1
        |
1.1     +- Area A
        |  |
1.1.1   |  +- Line 1A 
        |
1.2     +- Area B 
           | 
1.2.1      +- Line 1B
           |  |
1.2.1.1    |  +- Machine X
           |
1.2.2      +- Line 2B  
```

To do so, all parent nodes of "1.2.1.1" need to be put into the `expandedNodes` array, not just its immediate parent node:

```json
{
    "type": "modify",
    "id": "tree",
    "set": [
        {
            "name": "model.state.expandedNodes",
            "value": [ "1", "1.2", "1.2.1" ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Search Table State
In addition to the `state` property, there is also a `searchTable.state` property which keeps track of active row selection, filter and search options of the tree search table. Refer to the table [state](../table/README.md#state) property for more details.

### Actions

Nodes and icon of nodes support action hooks. An action hook supports the standard action pipeline. The message payload is de data of the node.

Supported action hooks:

- `onClick`: when user clicks on the node or on one of its icons.
- `onSelect`: triggers with `onClick` or when a node is selected using the search table. 
- `onSelectionChanged`: triggers when the selection is changed. That is to say, it is only triggered the first time if the same node is selected multiple times in succession. 

Generic `onClick` action hook for a node:

```json
    {
        "actions": {
            "onClick": {
                "type": "send",
                "to": "debugger"
            }
        }
    }
```

Generic `onClick` action hook for a node icon:

```jsonc
{
    "icons": [
        {
            "icon": "‚ÑπÔ∏è",               // Only applies when there is no matching rule.
            "actions": {
                "onClick": {
                    "type": "send",
                    "to": "debugger"
                }
            }
        }
    ]
}
```

A specific action can be configured within the rules. These are dominant to the generic actions.

Action on a specific icon:

```jsonc
{
    "icons": [
        {
            "icon": "‚ÑπÔ∏è",               // Only applies when there is no matching rule.
            "rules": [
                {
                    "match": {
                        "t": 1034       // Type in the form of the class number
                    },
                    "icon": "üç∫",
                    "actions": {
                        "onClick": {
                            "type": "send",
                            "to": "debugger"
                        }
                    }
                }
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

### Search Table

In order to show the proper and desired node fields in search table, a `searchTable` configuration can be made. The prompted search table is a [Table widget](../table/README.md). Currently only `schema` and `options` are supported.

```json
{
    "searchTable": {
        "schema": [
            {
                "name": "nodeName",
                "title": "Name",
                "sort": "asc"
            },
            {
                "name": "text",
                "title": "Description"
            },
            {
                "name": "path",
                "title": "Path"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Note: deep linking of node properties is not supported.

```jsonc
{
    "searchTable": {
        "schema": [
            {
                "name": "props.name",       // NOT SUPPORTED
                "title": "Name",
            }
        ]
    }
}
```
