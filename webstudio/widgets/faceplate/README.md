# Faceplate

This widget can be used to show value, quality and timestamp (VQT) of a dynamic object from the system. It will subscribe to the data changes of the specified object.

Note: This is a preliminary version and a visual copy of the faceplate from DataStudio. It will be changed in the future but will always show the VQT.

## Model

```json
{
    "type": "faceplate",
    "path": "/System/Core/Examples/Demo Data/Process Data/DC4711"
}
```
